A collection of algorithms for creating and managing multilevel linked lists

Code for a multilevel linked list: 

Guidelines for contribution:
- primary language is csharp, but other languages are also appreciated
- if an algorithm has already been added, make improvements to the existing code rather than adding the algorithm a second time
- adding short comments explaining your code isnt required, but would be really helpful
- unless code is causing a major issue, please do not entirely delete other people's work
